Duplicate GiS events were defined by Alex as having the same UserID and SampleID
occurring within 3 minutes of each other. This should be impossibe in the context of the game.

The Py code deletes any duplicate data leaving only the one with the earliest timestamp.
Test data is also removed.

The code works by comparing timestamps from the newest and oldest events currently in memory.
If the oldest event occurred more than 3 minutes before the newest event then the oldest event
cannot be a duplicate so is printed to the output file and removed from active memory.
Old events are iteratively removed until all events in active memory are within 3 minutes of
the newest.

The newest row is then sequentially compared to the remaining rows. If the newest row is a duplicate
of one of the other rows then the newest row is removed.

At the end of the file, any rows still in active memory are also printed to the output files.


In GiS there are around 3 088 000 input events. This code should output 2 656 319 unique events.


The code currently outputs UserID, SampleID, time and flightData
